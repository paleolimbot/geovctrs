#' Test for geovctrs
#'
#' A geovctr is a geometry-like collection of objects. In the geovctrs
#' package, [wkt()], [wkb()], [geo_collection()],
#' [geo_xy()], [geo_rect()], and [geo_segment()] are all geovctrs.
#' Extension packages can either use these types or
#' implement the [as_geovctr()] generic
#' to take advantage of a wide range of processing functions, including
#' coercion, plotting, and summary information.
#'
#' This package is intended to allow for a variety of in-memory
#' representations of geometry, as there are many examples where
#' simple geometries can be efficiently parameterized without
#' resorting to storing every coordinate of every vertex
#' (built-in examples include [geo_xy()], [geo_segment()], and
#' [geo_rect()]). These types do, however, have unambiguous
#' representations as geometries, and thus should be able to be
#' used wherever a geometry is appropriate.
#'
#' For an object to be a "geovctr", it must:
#'
#' - Be a vctr ([vctrs::vec_is()] must be `TRUE`). This ensures that it will
#'   work with [tibble::tibble()] and other tidyverse functions such as
#'   [tidyr::unnest()] and [dplyr::group_by()] / [dplyr::mutate()] /
#'   [dplyr::summarise()].
#'
#' - Inherit from `"geovctr"`. This makes it work automatically with
#'   functions like [geo_plot()] and [geo_bbox()] that have a default
#'   implementation for something that can be coerced to [wkt()],
#'   [wkb()], or [geo_collection()].
#'
#' - Have the ability to be casted to [wkt()], [wkb()], and [geo_collection()]
#'   using [vec_cast()]. These casts power the default implementations of
#'   functions like [geo_plot()] and [geo_bbox()], and allow geometries to
#'   be combined using [vctrs::vec_c()] (which powers row-binding in
#'   tidyverse functions). This means implementing the appropriate
#'   [vctrs::vec_cast()] methods for a class.
#'
#' - Have the ability to be combined with [wkt()], [wkb()], and [geo_collection()]
#'   using [vec_c()] in both directions. This helps support processing functions
#'   that return a class to be combined with the output of other functions.
#'   This might require a [vctrs::vec_ptype()] implementation for
#'   a class.
#'
#' You can test these expectations for a given object using [expect_geovctr()].
#'
#' A secondary class of object is one that *could*  be interpreted as a geovctr,
#' but in most cases can't be. One example of this is a character vector,
#' which *could* be well-known text, but probably isn't. However, when the
#' user passes it to a function like [geo_plot()] or [geo_bbox()], it
#' probably *is* well-known text. Similarly, a `data.frame` or
#' [tibble::tibble()] probably doesn't contain a geometry column,
#' but when passed to a function that operates on geometries,
#' it's likely that it does. The geovctrs package supports these
#' objects with the [as_geovctr()] generic, which means you can
#' pass these objects anywhere you would pass a first-class
#' geometry vector.
